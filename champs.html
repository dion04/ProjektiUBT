                Twice slain and thrice born, Mordekaiser is a brutal warlord
                from a foregone epoch, who uses his necromantic sorcery to bind
                souls into an eternity of servitude. Few now remain who remember
                his earlier conquests, or know the true extent of his powers—but
                there are some ancient souls that do, and they fear the day when
                he may return to claim dominion over both the living and the
                dead.

                The Noxian occupation of Ionia produced many heroes, none more
                unlikely than young Irelia of Navori. Trained in the ancient
                dances of her province, she adapted her art for war, using the
                graceful and carefully practised movements to levitate a host of
                deadly blades. After proving herself as a fighter, she was
                thrust into the role of resistance leader and figurehead, and to
                this day remains dedicated to the preservation of her homeland.

                A leader of Ionia’s growing criminal underworld, Sett rose to
                prominence in the wake of the war with Noxus. Though he began as
                a humble challenger in the fighting pits of Navori, he quickly
                gained notoriety for his savage strength, and his ability to
                take seemingly endless amounts of punishment. Now, having
                climbed through the ranks of local combatants, Sett has muscled
                to the top, reigning over the pits he once fought in.

                needles, and sewing thread. So much is new to her, but Gwen
                remains joyfully determined to fight for the good that survives
                in a broken world.

                An Ionian of deep resolve, Yasuo is an agile swordsman who

                he was falsely accused of murdering his master—unable to prove
                his innocence, he was forced to slay his own brother in
                self-defense. In time, his master’s true killer was revealed,
                and his brother mysteriously returned from death, yet Yasuo
                still could not forgive himself for all he had done. Now, he
                wanders the world with only the wind to guide his blade.

                within Ionia’s ruling council, the serial killer now works as
                their cabal's assassin. Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin
                creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims and
                onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his
                gruesome theater, making him the ideal choice to send the most
                powerful of messages: terror.

              indifference of what lies beyond it. Many Runeterrans sing songs
              that ponder his extraordinary nature, yet they all agree that the
              cosmic vagabond is drawn to artifacts of great magical power.
              Surrounded by a jubilant choir of helpful meeps, it is impossible
              to mistake his actions as malevolent, as Bard always serves the
              greater good… in his own odd way.
